Javascript Data Types   
---------------------------
JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types 
in JavaScript.

1)Primitive data type
2)Non-primitive (reference) data type
          
JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is 
dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any
type of values such as numbers, strings etc.

String:	represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
Number:	represents numeric values e.g. 100
Boolean:	represents boolean value either false or true
Undefined:	represents undefined value
Null:	represents null i.e. no value at all
Object:	represents instance through which we can access members
Array: represents group of similar values
RegExp:	represents regular expression
BigInt: It was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.A BigInt value is 
created by appending n to the end of an integer
Symbol: The symbol type is used to create unique identifiers for objects. We have to mention it here for the 
sake of completeness, but also postpone the details till we know objects.
